                            </p>
                            
                              Time to formulate your Learning Plan! Write your findings on a temporary document
                               (word, google docs, text edit etc). The Learning Plan needs to include the following elements:
                             <br>
                             <br>
                             <h6> What is your long term goal and or career pathway? </h6>
                              <hr>
                              I don’t have a concrete goal yet but I will see how much I can learn and what comes to me easily.
                               I would like to create a blockchain in near future but just starting a junior web developer job within
                                6 months is a short term goal. 
                              <hr>
                              <h6> What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h6>
                             
                              <hr>
                              I want to be more comfortable with myself talking in front of a bunch of people. I have a fear of speaking
                               in mass. Which is absurd  because I won’t stop 
                              in small group of people 
                              <hr>
                              <h6></h6>
                              <h6>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h6>
                              
                              <hr>
                              Without being too proud or self sabotaging  painly writing my strengths would be 
                              { good listener,  patient , a bit of empath, free spirit , macro vision etc .} 
                               & my limitations would be { overthinker , external validation ,
                                 reserve at first, etc .. 
                                <hr>
                                <h6>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
                                  This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely 
                                  with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h6>
                               
                               <hr>
                               I would have to be focused and find my flow. For me sometimes things don't come instantly  
                               but once I find my rhythm I learn really fast. So I trust myself that I will overcome my 
                               limitations and shine. 
                               
                               <hr>
                               <h6> A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h6>
                             
                              <hr>
                              This one is very important, and yes I have to remind myself to seek help from a facilitator 
                              asap when I'm stuck. 
                              <hr>
                              <h6>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h6>
                              
                              <hr>
                              The facilitators are already amazing. I can’t expect more,  they have given us a really good 
                              learning environment to learn. And they are very quick to respond.  
                              <hr>
                              <h6> Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. 
                                For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</h6>
                             
                              <hr>
                              Fortunately, I don’t have much other commitment during bootcamp.
