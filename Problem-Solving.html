                              Problem solving is a key skill you will utilise as a developer. Here are some problem solving techniques you can try today:
                              </p>
                              <hr>

                              <strong> Pseudocode</strong>
                              <hr>
                              Many of the techniques mentioned above can be applied to all sorts of (non-technical) problems, but pseudocode is coding specific and incredibly useful to help you think through your code.
                              Pseudocode is not actual code, but rather comments that tell you how the code will eventually look. It is informal, plainly written steps that form the rough draft or outline of your code.
                              Pseudocoding involves taking a little time before you get into writing the code to break down your plan into small steps. This means you don't have to worry about making the whole thing work at once, but can instead focus on just coding one step at a time. This can be useful for helping you break down a complicated problem, but can also be used if one developer needs to leave instructions for another to complete the code later.
                              Because pseudocode is the steps rather than the code itself, you don't need to include the fine details of what needs to happen. It's a bit like recalling a recipe you know, you don't need all the details immediately, you just need to know the ingredients needed and can work the rest out when you get to it. For example, to make brownies:
                              <br>
                              <ul>// put butter, sugar, and cocoa in bowl and then microwave </ul>
                              <ul>  // add eggs and vanilla and mix through</ul>
                              <ul>  // add flour and mix until thick</ul>
                              <ul> // bake! </ul>
                             
                             
                             
                               
                              You can see that we didn't include any details, just general steps.
                              Once you have written pseudocode, you may find you need to change the order of steps, or you might discover that you have forgotten some and need to add them in - and that's okay! This is only a first draft and it will inevitably change as you come to write the code itself.
                              The rubber ducky method
                              This is best explained through a little story. Picture this: you're a programmer working with a team of people. You're doing your day job, coding whatever it is you need to code, and then you run into a problem. For whatever reason, the program isn't working as it should.
                               <br>
                              So you decide to walk down the hall and tell your colleague that you're dealing with a stubborn bug. They agree to help you out and ask you what exactly is wrong. You start explaining the problem in detail and find that, in the middle of your explanation, you've hit upon a solution.
                             
                              This actually happens in the real world more often than you think. You might be wondering what all that has to do with rubber ducks. Well, you could have confided in a plastic yellow buddy (or any inanimate object), instead of disturbing someone else.
                              Reading error messages  <br>
                              Error messages consist of two parts, the error message and the stack trace .The error-message is “what’s wrong” — good error messages are helpful and tell you what you should do and bad error-messages sometimes look like something that could summon Cthulhu
                              <br>

                              <strong>Console.logging </strong>
                              <hr>
                              The console.log() is a function in JavaScript which is used to print any kind of variables defined before in it or to just print any message that needs to be displayed to the user. 
                              It is super useful to know the bugs in codes. 
                              <br>

                              <strong> Googling </strong> 
                             
                              <hr>
                              Simply googling can solve half of the problem. Everything is out there, it is just you must know how to grab them and use them to solve your problems in programming. 
                              Asking your peers for help     <br>
                              This is the best way to learn , because you and your peers are working on similar problems so they might know more than you or you may know something that they don’t know. It's a great way to learn and understand things. 
                              <br>

                              <strong>Asking coaches for help </strong> 
                             
                              <hr>
                        
                              There is no question about the coaches being helpful for problem solving. They are here longer in the industry, they know how to solve problems. Rather than being stuck in the same problem for too long don’t forget to get help from coaches. They will have some solution for sure. 
                              Improving your process with reflection   <br>
                              Like with everything else in programming as well, reflection can teach you more than you have understood during the period of studying. It's like harddrive in your memory to understand stuff.
