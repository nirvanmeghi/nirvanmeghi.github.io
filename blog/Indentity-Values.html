                Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration

            </p>

            <p>

                <strong>Identity & Values</strong>
                <br>
            </p>
            <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">
                This is one of the very abstract parts of the personality I have never given time to think about. I
                don't have any definitive answers to my Identity & Values.
                <Br>
                I was born in Nepal, a small himalayan country, a landlocked country. So living in New Zealand is
                something that I find very fascinating. I have grown in the base of hills, mountains & valleys, so every
                night when I go to sleep I go back to those places in my dreams. It's very rare that I don’t dream about
                it. It’s like I have a place in my subconscious that I have to go there every night to get recharge.
                <Br></Br>
                I was a very curious kid, very introverted but spiritual. Very dependent on parents. My teenage years
                were the most challenging part of my life. I think I'm trying to find some healing. As a teenager I
                struggled with my identity although when I was alone with nature I used to be one with the river &
                trees, those experiences were surreal, there I had definitely more eagerness to live & I strive to be
                that again. And those laughter I shared with my friends I can still hear their echo even though it
                happened a long time ago.
                <Br></Br>
                So my Identity & Values are ever changing as I grow and evolve.
            </p>
            <Br></Br>
            <p> <strong> Strengths and Limitations</strong> </p>
            <br>

            <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">
                My strength is perseverance. Sometimes even though everything goes the other way. I see the bigger
                picture and try to find the solution. I tend not to be afraid to do new things. Mainly open to
                others.
                <br>
                My limitation is listening to my self doubting voice.
