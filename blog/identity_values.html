                                This is one of the very abstract parts of the personality I have never given time to
                                think about. I don't have any definitive answers to my Identity & Values.
                                <br>
                                <br>

                                I was born in Nepal, a small himalayan country, a landlocked country. So living in New
                                Zealand is something that I find very fascinating. I have grown in the base of hills,
                                mountains & valleys, so every night when I go to sleep I go back to those places in my
                                dreams. It's very rare that I don’t dream about it. It’s like I have a place in my
                                subconscious that I have to go there every night to get recharge.
                                <br>
                                <br>

                                I was a very curious kid, very introverted but spiritual. Very dependent on parents. My
                                teenage years were the most challenging part of my life. I think I'm trying to find some
                                healing now. As a teenager I struggled with my identity although when I was alone with
                                nature I used to be one with the river & trees, those experiences were surreal, back
                                then I had definitely more eagerness to live & now I strive to be that again.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                So my Identity & Values are ever changing as I grow and evolve.

                                <br>
                                <strong>Strengths and Limitations</strong>
                                <hr>
                                <br>
                                My strength is perseverance. Sometimes even though everything goes the other way. I see
                                the bigger picture and try to find the solution. I tend not to be afraid to do new
                                things. Mainly open to others.
                                <br>
                                My limitation is listening to my self doubting voice.
